### AWS mini programs and projects

Author: Ajay Thorve

As part of my graduate level cloud computing course at NYU, I had to do some cool projects, some of them are:

1.  Creating AWS instances programmtically using Python 3(boto3 library)


<i>Note: Your aws account should already be configured, even locally, using the aws configure command(aws cli), see AWS documentation on how to set that up.
